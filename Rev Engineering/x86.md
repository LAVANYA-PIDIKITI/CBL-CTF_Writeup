Explanation:

1) mov $0x3f2, %eax: Move the value 0x3f2 into the EAX register. <br>
2) mov $0x44c, %ebx: Move the value 0x44c into the EBX register. <br>
3) and %ebx, %eax: Perform a bitwise AND operation between the values in EBX and EAX, storing the result in EAX. <br>
4) mov $0x3f2, %eax: Move the value 0x3f2 into the EAX register again. <br>
5) mov $0x44c, %ebx: Move the value 0x44c into the EBX register again. <br>
6) or %ebx, %eax: Perform a bitwise OR operation between the values in EBX and EAX, storing the result in EAX. <br>
7) not %eax: Perform a bitwise NOT operation on the value in EAX. <br>
8) int $0x80: Trigger a software interrupt to invoke a system call. The specific system call to be executed depends on the values in the registers. <br>

Now I understood that the numbers involved here are 0x3f2 and 0x44c, and to these we've to perform the "AND" operation. <br>
