It had a webpage and on clicking that it said hunt for flags

# Solution
Now as the title says it's source , I explored the inspect part of each and every element but eveyrthing seemed to be normal , that's when i added `/` to the URL and i saw there were two extra files and bit of change in css of the website
The flag was hidden as two parts in the source one being in css file and other one in style.css and script.js
